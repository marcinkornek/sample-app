# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## I added extensions to the sample application proposed in last chapter:
1. Replies
  users can send private messages to each other using @username before message (i.e. "@username_1 Hi buddy" is visible only for user with username: "username_1" )

2. Follower notifications

  users receive an email notification when they gain a new follower, users can disable this option in account settings

3. Password reminders

  In this tutorial app authorization is written from scratch. Users can reset their password.

4. Signup confirmation

  After creating new account users have to confirm their email before sign in.

5. RSS feed

  Users can read microposts from followed users via RSS and Atom.

6. Search

  Users can be searched.

## A also added more extensions:
1. video player
2. endless scrolling
3. hide users/hide posts
4. autocomplete in "user search"
5. button to change header color
6. password strength checker
